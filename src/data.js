    question: 'What is cryptocurrency?',
    answer:
      'Cryptocurrency consists of web-based digital assets that use cryptographic functions to conduct financial transactions. Digital assets typically utilize blockchain technology to gain transparency and decentralization to varying degrees. Digital assets include Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, which are backed by fiat for lower fluctuation, and tokens, which can sometimes be representative of units used within an organization to move currency around the globe or for gaming purposes.',

    question: 'What is the blockchain?',
    answer:
      'A growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks. A blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. The blockchain has been described as "an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way"',

    question: 'What is Bitcoin?',
    answer:
      'Bitcoin (₿) is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital asset — arguably, the most popular — and typically takes up half of all digital asset trading volume on most given days.',

    question: 'What is DeFi?',
    answer:
      'DeFi (or “decentralized finance”) is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more — but it’s faster and doesn’t require paperwork or a third party. As with crypto generally, DeFi is global, peer-to-peer (meaning directly between two people, not routed through a centralized system), pseudonymous, and open to all. ',

    question: 'Why is DeFi important?',
    answer:
      'DeFi takes the basic premise of Bitcoin — digital money — and expands on it, creating an entire digital alternative to Wall Street, but without all the associated costs (think office towers, trading floors, banker salaries). This has the potential to create more open, free, and fair financial markets that are accessible to anyone with an internet connection.',

    question: 'What is Staking?',
    answer:
      'Staking generally refers to the holding of your cryptocurrency funds in a wallet and hence supporting the functionality of a blockchain system. The cryptos are being locked in their wallets by the stakeholders. They are then rewarded by the network in return. Staking provides a way of making an income. Staking is a process similar to having a savings account with your bank and earning interest on the deposits. Staking is a great addition to the cryptocurrency space which offers notable applications. Staking also brings the aspects of familiarity, engagement, and reward into the ecosystem. This makes the investment all the more worthwhile.',

    question: 'What is a crypto wallet?',
    answer:
      'Crypto wallets keep your private keys – the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies – safe and accessible, allowing you to send and receive cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. They come in many forms, from hardware wallets like Ledger (which looks like a USB stick) to mobile apps like Coinbase Wallet, which makes using crypto as easy as shopping with a credit card online.',

    question: 'What is mining?',
    answer:
      'Mining is the process that Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies use to generate new coins and verify new transactions. It involves vast, decentralized networks of computers around the world that verify and secure blockchains – the virtual ledgers that document cryptocurrency transactions. In return for contributing their processing power, computers on the network are rewarded with new coins. It’s a virtuous circle: the miners maintain and secure the blockchain, the blockchain awards the coins, the coins provide an incentive for the miners to maintain the blockchain.',

    question: 'What are NFTs?',
    answer:
      'NFTs (or “non-fungible tokens”) are a special kind of cryptoasset in which each token is unique — as opposed to “fungible” assets like Bitcoin and dollar bills, which are all worth exactly the same amount. Because every NFT is unique, they can be used to authenticate ownership of digital assets like artworks, recordings, and virtual real estate or pets.',

    question: 'What is a Smart Contract?',
    answer:
      'Just like any contract, smart contracts lay out the terms of an agreement or deal. What makes smart contracts “smart,” however, is that the terms are established and executed as code running on a blockchain, rather than on paper sitting on a lawyer’s desk. Smart contracts expand on the basic idea behind Bitcoin — sending and receiving money without a “trusted intermediary” like a bank in the middle —  to make it possible to securely automate and decentralize virtually any kind of deal or transaction, no matter how complex. And because they run on a blockchain like Ethereum, smart contracts allow developers to build apps that take advantage of blockchain security, reliability, and accessibility while offering sophisticated peer-to-peer functionality — everything from loans and insurance to logistics and gaming. offer security, reliability, and borderless accessibility.',
